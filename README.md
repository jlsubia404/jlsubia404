### Hello guys, I'm Jorge Subía 👋 and this is a little bit about me ⤵️.

Since I was a kid, I was always curious by knowing how computers work, even when I never had a computer at home until going to college. 
Nowadays, I am really blessed for working with computers especially in software development.

I have been working with Java for around 8 years, however currently, I'm learning NodeJS 🌱, I guess I am in a transition from Java to Javascript.
